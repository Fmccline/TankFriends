# TankFriends
Tanks game that I made in Unity following this [tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/tanks-tutorial) with my own modifications.

## Summary
Up to 8 players can play with controllers.
There are two modes:
1) Deathmatch: Players are scored based on how many other tanks they kill subtracted by how many times the player dies.
1) Survival: The last tank standing wins.

I used Unity's [ML-Agents](https://unity3d.com/machine-learning) to create AI that players can play against.
